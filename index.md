## About Me

I am currently a doctoral student (DPhil) at the University of Oxford, where I am a member of the OxCaV Group, supervised by Professor Alessandro Abate. Previously, I worked at INRIA Rennes as a research engineer. I studied Control Engineering at the University of Padova, where I graduated with honors (magna cum laude) in 2015. I recently visited the ERATO MMSD Group at NII Tokyo.

## Research Interests

I am interested in problems relating to control theory, formal verification, and machine learning. 
A significant portion of research devises approximate, data-driven models for a population of stochastic (hybrid) systems. The research has been applied in collaboration with RTE, to shape the EU regulation on the grid connection code.
Lately I have been developing an approach to automatically synthesise Lyapunov and barrier functions, exploiting SMT solvers and synthesis techniques based on nonlinear optimisation, statistical regression and neural architectures. A software tool will be available soon.
